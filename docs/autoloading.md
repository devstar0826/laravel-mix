# Autoloading

Webpack offers the necessary facilities to make a module available as a variable in every other module required by webpack. If you're working with a particular plugin or library that depends upon a global variable, such as jQuery, `mix.autoload()` may prove useful to you.

Consider the following example:

```js
mix.autoload({
    jquery: ['$', 'window.jQuery']
});
```

This snippet specifies that webpack should prepend `var $ = require('jquery')` to every location that it encounters either the global `$` identifier, or `window.jQuery`. Nifty!
