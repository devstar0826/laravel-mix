    Before posting this issue, please perform the following steps, and confirm that the issue is still present.

1. Update Laravel Mix to the latest version.
2. Nuke your dependencies, and reinstall from scratch: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`.
3. Check your `package.json` file, and ensure that there are no old Laravel Elixir dependencies that might be interfering with Mix.
4. Are you using a custom .babelrc file? If so, that may affect your compile, as we depend upon the es2015 plugin with modules set to false.
